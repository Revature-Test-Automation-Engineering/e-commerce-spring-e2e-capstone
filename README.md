The team inherited a previous capstone project where that cohort created an e-commerce application. Our objective is to 
test the current system, its features, and its API endpoints. Using the methodology of behavior driven 
development (BDD), the testing team will create and execute a suite of manual, automated, E2E, and API tests to 
thoroughly test features related to the software requirements. The team will then inform the client of the current 
working status of the application and its features.

## Technologies Used
